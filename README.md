# Color-Image-Compression-Using-Unsupervised-Learning

In this project, you are given a full color image. Each pixel of this color image has three components: red, green, and blue components. Each
component is an 8-bit unsigned char. There are thus totally 2^24 possible colors. For certain computers which can only display 256 (or 2^8) different
colors, that is, each pixel only has 8 bits representing the color information, you are asked to find the best 2^8 colors that can approximate the original
full-color image.
